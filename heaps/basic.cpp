// 1. What is heap
// -> It type of data struture that have heap properties
//    heap properties are max heap and min heap properties

// 2. What is max and min heap properties
// -> Max heap : here node will be bigger than their children
//    Min heap : here node will be smaller than its children

// 3. How to implement heap using stl
// -> we can import priority_queue<int> from queue package
// -> for Max heap priority_queue<int>maxHeap;
// -> for Min heap priority_queue<int, vector<int> , greater<int>> minHeap;

// 4. What are the function and methods that it provides
// -> Same as all stl function like , push , pop , empty , size etc
