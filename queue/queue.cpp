// 1. What is queue
// -> It is linear Data structure that follows Last In First Out (LIFO) 

// 2. What are terms related to this
// -> some of the terms related to queue are 
//    1. front() which will return the front element same as the top() in stack
//    2. rear() which will return the last element of the queue
//    3. push() used to pushing value in rear and then move rear to next 
//    4. pop() used to remove the value that will front element
//    5. empty() used to check whether queue is empty or not
//    6. size() used to get the size of the queue

// 3. How LIFO works here
// -> Here whenever new element is added then it just add value to current rear 
//    and then move rear to one step ahead and when element is to removed then 
//    front element is removed 

// 4. How can we use queue
// -> we can import queue using #include <queue> module
