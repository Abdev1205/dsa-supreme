// 1. What is Dynamic Programming
// -> It is technique in programming where we store the value of computation
//    and use it when needed

// 2. when can we apply the dynamic programming
// -> If 2 condition is there then we can apply the dynamic programming
//    1. Overlapping Subproblem : same problem ko baar bar solve karna (fibonacci series)
//    2. Optmal Substrcuture: Optimal solution of bigger problem cab be calculated by small optimal solutions

// 3. What are the two approach in DP
// -> we have two approach in dp are
//    1. TopDown Approach : It is reacursive Approach 
//    2. BottomUp approach : It is iterative Approach using tabulation method
